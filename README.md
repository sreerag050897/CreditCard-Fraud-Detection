# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection
Skill set used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,SK-Learn, Imblearn
Description:
  •	A project in which we build a model from the given dataset using the feature and predict whether the credit card transaction done is legitimate or fraudulent.
  •	Here the data set was loaded using Pandas and later some EDA was done using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  •	Tried to build the model using Logistic Regression from linear model of Sklearn model
  •	Thereafter the data was oversampled using imblearn module for the machine to learn more and become efficient.
  •	Thus finally the model was finally build with around 96 percentage accuracy.
